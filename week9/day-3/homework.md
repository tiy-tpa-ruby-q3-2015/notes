# The End of the Tour

What a nine weeks it has been. Just a short time ago we were using the terminal for the first time, learning our way around Atom, running `ruby mycode.rb`, and learning basic syntax.

Now we are on the verge of creating our own apps for the first time! Take a moment to congratulate yourself on how far you have come!

# Last Homework (at least of lecture time)

# Adventure Mode

- Add a post to your blog. Suggested topics: _the idea for my final app_, _reflection on what I've learned_, _what I want to do after The Iron Yard_
- Work on completing issues in the `Hours` repo. Ask Kurtis for an issue, or confirm with him that an issue is available to work on.

# Explorer Mode

- Add ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound handling to either your _Rails Dictionary_ or your _Iron Topics_ app
- Write up some of your user stories and/or make some wireframes for your final app idea.
