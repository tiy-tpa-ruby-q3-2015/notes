## Enumerable Practice

This assignment practices what we learned about `Enumerable` -- We continue to use various `enumerable` methods such as `all?` and `any?` in our recent homework. This practice reinforces some of the other enumerables available to us.

*Explorer Mode*

- Go to this URL https://github.com/tiy-tpa-ruby-q3-2015/green_eggs_and_ham
- [ ] _Fork_ the repo using the github web ui (click on the FORK icon in the upper right)
- [ ] _clone_ the repository to your computer. Ensure you are in the main directory where you keep your various projects (e.g. `~/tiy`) and are *NOT* inside another homework assignment's directory.
- [ ] Follow the directions in the readme (which you can see on the github page as well)

*Adventure Mode*

- [ ] Write a test to validate how many punctuation marks are in the text. Write the *TEST* into the test_green_eggs_and_ham.rb _first_ -- you will have to manually count the punctuation. Then write a test to expect that as the result of a method called `punctuation_count` defined in the class in `green_eggs_and_ham.rb`
- [ ] Write a test to validate the lines that are in the file the most often. (excluding blanks) -- Figure out _yourself_ which lines this are. Then write a test to expect that as the result of a method called `most_common_line` defined in the class in `green_eggs_and_ham.rb`
