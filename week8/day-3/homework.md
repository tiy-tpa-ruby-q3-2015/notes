# Stretching

_It is time review a past homework and give ourselves another stretch._

# Explorer Mode

- [ ] Find a homework from week four or later and implement _Adventure Mode_ if you have not already completed it
- [ ] Give me a link to the repository where you updated the code

# Adventure Mode

- [ ] Find a homework from week four or later and implement _Epic Mode_ if you have not already completed it
- [ ] Give me a link to the repository where you updated the code

# Epic Mode

- [ ] Ask me about an _Epic Mode_ homework you'd like to extend further. Either come to me with an idea or ask me what would be the next stretch.
