- Know the different types of tests
  - Unit
    - Tests specific methods of specific objects
    - Tests in _isolation_, sending specific inputs, expecting specific output
    - Tends to have single assertion per test
    - One class per test file (books_test.rb, etc)
  - Controller
    - Tests that the correct parameters are extracted
    - Tests that the correct models are found/created/deleted
    - Tests that the correct instance variables (via *assigns* is loaded)
  - Integration
    - Tests that everything works together
    - Might test multiple requests in a single test
    - Might test that the correct HTML/JSON is output
    - Typically needs test fixtures/factories to be created
