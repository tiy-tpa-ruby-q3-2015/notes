# Surf & Paddle

## Description

As a developer on the web, you will sometimes be tasked with creating an html page simply from an image file.  In this assignment, you&#x27;ll be taking an image and turning it into a functioning website.

* **Unlike our previous assignment, you should be striving to recreate this mockup as close as you can.**
  * Match fonts, sizes, colors, everything. You can use different images, since the stock images in the mockup are not provided.
  * The resulting web page cannot just be an image of the assignment centered on the page :trollface:
* The menu items need to also have differing states based on a hover, and although not articulated in the provided image, they need to be styled.
* Using Bootstrap (or similar) is optional, but probably not recommended at this point.

## Explorer Mode
