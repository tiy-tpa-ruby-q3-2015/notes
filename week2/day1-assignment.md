## HTML/CSS Basics

- [ ] Read [this article](http://blog.froont.com/brief-history-of-web-design-for-designers/) on the history of web design.
- [ ] Compose a short (a few paragraphs) blog that summarizes your thoughts on the web; where's it's been an where it's going.
- [ ] Create and HTML document that contains your blog. It should have a title, a byline and the article itself.

### Explorer Mode

- [ ] Mark up your document with valid HTML.
- [ ] Use at least 12 different HTML tags.
- [ ] Add at least one image to your page.
- [ ] Use valid CSS to style the page.
- [ ] Research the `id` and `class` HTML attributes.
- [ ] Use at least 12 CSS statements to style the page (a statement includes a selector and a number of properties). Try to use `id` and `class` attributes in your CSS selectors where relevant.
- [ ] All of your HTML and CSS should be formatted cleanly and consistently.

**Note:** Adventure and Epic Modes will be published later today.
